This repository analyzes the site inventory capacity of Mountain View's July and November housing element drafts. 

In analysis.ipynb, I find that the city's housing plan overestimates pipeline capacity by 33% and overestimates average precise plan capacity by roughly 100%. Adjusting these assumptions to account for historical trends, I find the city is likely to fall short of its affordable housing targets by ~6k units.
